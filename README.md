# Text-Editor-PWA
## Discription

this is my 19th assignment my task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.



-my motivation was to practice what i learned in the bootcamp untill June 13 2023
